            <h1> Endless Column </h1>


            <p> The first time he exposed the column, made only by two identical modules in a rhombus shape, was at the
                show in the Tuileries, in 1926, entitled Endless Column. In the same year, Brancusi lives a big joy to
                see his work exhibited in the garden of a friend, the photographer Edward Steichen, in Voulangis. </p>
            <p> It&apos;s the first time that the column takes the form of a true work of art. With its seven meters
                height, consisting of nine whole modules and two half modules, the column emerged solemn in the center
                of the park. A few months later, Edward Steichen had to return in the United States and Brancusi had to
                recover the column from the park.</p>
            <p>This experience has given him the courage to dream that one day will find the right place to emerge a
                column of a considerable size. His dream came truth only ten years later, in 1937&hyphen;1938, when it
                is given the project of the column as a monument in memory of the fallen soldiers in World War I, on the
                Jiu Valley. The proposal was received with great joy by Brancusi considering he wanted to do something
                that remained in the memory of his nation, such as a monument.</p>
            <p> The Endless Column of Targu Jiu was built of stainless steel, composed of fifteen entire rhomboid
                modules and two half modules, with a height of almost thirty meters. The artist has lived intensely the
                construction&apos;s development and at the project implementation has worked with the engineer Stefan
                Georgescu&hyphen;Gorjan, the son of an old childhood friend. Brancusi was present during the work of the
                beloved Endless Column and he has recorded various moments of the work, collecting everything in an
                archive of work in progress. </p>
            </p> The column was installed in a park just outside the city, in an open space that gives the impression of
                 exploding from the earth like a trunk that is attracted to the sky. An avenue, also called the Heroes
                 Avenue, connect the column with the park, where are the other two monuments. It&apos;s a path to the memory
                 of those who have sacrificed themselves for Romania and the Gate of Kiss is nothing more than just an
                 intermediary step towards the Table of Silence, the true place of meditation. It&apos;s an initiatory path
                 capable of purifying those who decide to follow it, in an atmosphere of respect and peace. </p>
            <p> The Endless Column symbolizes the concept of infinity and the infinite sacrifice of the Romanian
                soldiers. It is considered by Sydnei Geist the top point of the modern art. The Endless Column stacks 15
                rhomboidal modules, with a half&hyphen;unit at the top and bottom, making a total of 16. The incomplete
                top unit is thought to be the element that expresses the concept of the infinite. Br&acirc;ncu&#351;i
                had experimented with this form as early as 1918, with an oak version now found in the collection of the
                Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The modules were made in the central workshop of Petro&#351;ani
                (Atelierele Centrale Petro&#351;ani), assembled by Br&acirc;ncu&#351;i&apos;s friend engineer
                &#351;tefan Georgescu-Gorjan (1905&hyphen;1985), and completed on 27 October 1938. All 16 rhomboidal
                modules accumulate a total height of 29.3 m </p>
            <p> In the 1950s, the Romanian communist government planned to demolish the column, but this plan was never
                executed. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989 and the fall of the Communist regime, there was renewed
                interest in restoring the Column, which by that time suffered from tilting, cracking, metal corrosion,
                and an unstable foundation. For these reasons the site was listed in the 1996 World Monuments Watch by
                the World Monuments Fund. The restoration was facilitated by the Fund, which organized meetings for the
                stakeholders in 1998 and provided funding through American Express. Subsequently, the site was restored
                between 1998 and 2000 through a collaborative effort of the Romanian Government, the World Monuments
                Fund, the World Bank, and other Romanian and international groups. </p>
            <p> The enthusiasm of his countrymen gave him the courage to expand the project and create a complex of
                monumental works that will also include <b>The Table of Silence</b> and <b>The Gate of the Kiss</b>, to
                bring a true tribute to the heroes: admiration, gratitude, meditation and design in the memory of the
                future generations. The last two monuments were made of stone extracted from the mines of Banpotoc of
                Transylvania. </p>
