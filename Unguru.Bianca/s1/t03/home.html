        <h1> T&acirc;rgu&hyphen;Jiu</h1>

        <p>The city takes its name from the river Jiu, which runs through it. In antiquity, there was a Dacian village
            in around the location of today&apos;s city surrounded by forests. After the Roman conquests of Oltenia
            (101&hyphen;102), military units were stationed around the roads that connected different important routes
            at the
            time. During the digging of the Târgu Jiu &hyphen; Rovinari railroad, mosaics, coins, ceramics and Roman
            bricks were found in the south-eastern part of the city. This and ancient testimonies support the idea
            that Târgu Jiu was a commercial town (a vicus) while under the Roman Empire&apos;s rule. A very important
            route that connects the Danube to Transylvania runs through the city, so historians believe that part of the
            Roman army under Trajan&apos;s leadership stayed and then passed in the actual location of the city.</The>
        </p>The first written account of the city appears in a document dating from 23 November 1406 in an order signed
        by Mircea cel Batran. Since 1497, the city has been the seat of Gorj County. <br>

        <p>Constantin Br&acirc;ncu&#351;i, who had lived here as a boy, was commissioned to contribute to a memorial
            monument to the fighters of World War I, called Calea Eroilor, &quot;Heroes&apos; Street&quot;, which was
            finished in 1938. His large sculptures are now the main tourist attractions in Târgu Jiu: The Table of
            Silence,
            Stool Alley, The Gate of the Kiss, and The Endless Column. The latter is shown in the middle section of the
            city&apos;s coat of arms. <br>

            In the 1950s the Communist mayor planned to demolish Br&acirc;ncu&#351;i&apos;s &quot;bourgeois&quot; art.
            The plan was not carried out.</p>

        <h2>Coat of arms </h2>

        <p>The Coat of Arms of T&acirc;rgu Jiu consists of a Shield with seven towers. In the centre of the Shield lies the
            representation of Constantin Br&acirc;ncu&#351;i&apos;s Endless Column, a symbol of Romanian art and culture. In the right
            and left sides of the shield lies a golden lion holding a black sword, &quot;guarding&quot; the Column. The Lion is
            the ancient symbol of Oltenia, thought to be originating from the logo of one Rome&apos;s Legions station in this
            aria, the 13th Legion &quot;Gemina (Legio XIII Gemina)&quot;. It represents the bravery and combative spirit of the
            city&apos;s inhabitants.</p>
