    <h1> Table of Silence</h1>

    <p>The Table of Silence is made in limestone with dimensions: panel diameter 2, 15 meters, thick 0,43 m and the leg
        is 2 m in diameter and 0,45 m thick. It represents the table around which gather the soldiers before confronting
        their enemy. The Table is comprised of one large cut stone circle set atop another only somewhat smaller. Around
        the table, the artist placed twelve stools, each at a remove from the table and from one another. The table is
        larger than any one would find in a Romanian home.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the twelve stools stand in silence for the time disposed in hourglasses. Some make an analogy
        with The Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci the monument being composed of 12 seats (representing the apostles)
        and in the middle Jesus Christ place. Next comes the Chairs (stools) Alley, representing those who participate
        without any implication, waiting for the end.
        <br> This is not a circle begetting intimacy.</p>
    <p>In this sculpture, Brancusi brings a profound understanding of human grief to his work. Losing someone violently
        is hard. Losing the young without warning is harder still. The mourner yearns, aches, even bargains: &quot;If
        there could be just one more word, one more touch, one more moment with the belovedâ€¦, give me that. Then I could
        accept this death.&quot; We hunger for one word. There is nothing. Only silence. Silence is the dark truth of
        death.</p>
    <p>Thirty stone seats were designed by Brancusi to flank the walkway from the Table to the gate. The artist had
        benches built from some leftover slabs of stone. These were placed on either side the stone gate.</p>
    <p>The Table, walkway seating, and gateway all combine to provide the little riverside park with all the
        appurtenances of a sociable Romanian graveyard. This kind of architecture is familiar today as it was in
        Brancusi&apos;s youth.</p>
