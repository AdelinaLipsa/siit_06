        <h1> Gate of the Kiss </h1>


        <p> The Kiss Gate (Poarta Sarutului) is the second element of the ensemble. Technically speaking, it is
            5&comma;13 m high, 5&comma;45 m long and the pillars have 1,69 m width. This time&comma; the material used
            was Banpotoc travertine and in order to achieve the Gate, Brancusi was helped by two stone carvers&colon;
            Ion Alexandrescu from Bucharest and Golea from Dobrita. It&apos;s significance is very simple&colon the Kiss
            Gate makes the transition to another life, and the motif on the pillars stands for the eyes looking inside.
        </p>
        <p> Romanians erect gates at the entries to homes, to churches, graveyards. On these gates are incised
            protective devices as each gateway marks a passage from an impure place to a better place. Brancusi&apos;s
            design
            for the Gate of the Kiss is marked by an iconic image he returned to many times in his work: the kiss. </p>
        <p> The Gate of the Kiss is a simple post&hyphen;and&hyphen;lintel stone arrangement cut from locally quarried
            honey&hyphen;colored
            travertine. On the lintel forty paired kissing figures are incised. This lintel stylistically relates to the
            Montparnasse sculpture Brancusi had placed years earlier, at the request of friends, on a young, unmarried
            woman&apos;s grave in Paris. The eyes go first, not to the lintel, but to the gateway&apos;s two supporting
            posts
            which are emblazoned on all four sides with a bifurcated circular relief. It suggests a dividing cell, an
            ovarian egg, even the eyes of the soul as Brancusi had mentioned himself. It can also have other readings,
            among them, the tree of life.</p>
        <p>In Romania, the tree of life is visualized as a fir tree. The tree is sometimes depicted as a bisected circle
            with a branching bar, its roots triangulated into the earth, the branches spreading to the heavens, pulling
            the sun down to the earth mother. The device Brancusi cut into each side of the squared posts of the Gate of
            the Kiss similarly pulls the gaze downward to the earth below. In the Gate of the Kiss, we have the perfect
            synthesis of the sculptor&apos;s life&hyphen;long focus on love, presented in a wistful, yet erotic,
            post&hyphen;and&hyphen;lintel presentation.</p>
        <p>The significance of The Gate of the Kiss is making the transition to another life, symbolizing the triumph of
            life over death. The second meaning of the gate is that the kiss means union of the eight columns or regions
            that was attached to the mother country, Romania.</p>
