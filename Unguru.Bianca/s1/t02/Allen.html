        <p> June 3, 1926 &hyphen; April 5, 1997 </p>
    
        <p> Irwin Allen Ginsberg was an American poet, philosopher and writer. He is considered to be one of the
            leading
            figures of both the Beat Generation during the 1950s and the counterculture that soon followed. He
            vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism and sexual repression and was known as embodying
            various
            aspects of this counterculture, such as his views on drugs, hostility to bureaucracy and openness to
            Eastern
            religions.[1] He was one of many influential American writers of his time known as the Beat Generation,
            which included famous writers such as Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. </p>

        <p> Ginsberg is best known for his poem &quot;Howl&quot;, in which he denounced what he saw as the
            destructive
            forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States.In 1956, &quot;Howl&quot; was seized by San
            Francisco police and US Customs.In 1957, it attracted widespread publicity when it became the subject of
            an
            obscenity trial, as it described heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when sodomy laws made
            homosexual
            acts a crime in every U.S. state. &quot;Howl&quot; reflected Ginsberg&apos;s own homosexuality and his
            relationships with a number of men, including Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong partner.Judge Clayton W. Horn
            ruled that &quot;Howl&quot; was not obscene, adding, &quot;Would there be any freedom of press or speech
            if
            one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms?&quot; </p>

        <p> Biographical references in &quot;Howl&quot; </p>
        <p> Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac's Duluoz
            Legend).
            &quot;Howl&quot; is not only a biography of Ginsberg&apos;s experiences before 1955, but also a history
            of
            the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of &quot;Howl&quot; were his
            unresolved
            emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though &quot;Kaddish&quot; deals more explicitly with his
            mother,
            &quot;Howl&quot; in many ways is driven by the same emotions. &quot;Howl&quot; chronicles the
            development of
            many important friendships throughout Ginsberg&apos;s life. He begins the poem with &quot;I saw the best
            minds of my generation destroyed by madness&quot;, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady
            and
            Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature.This madness was the &quot;angry fix&quot; that
            society
            needed to function â€” madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on &quot;Carl Solomon!
            I&apos;m
            with you in Rockland&quot;, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom
            from
            his &quot;straightjacket&quot;. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography,
            his
            relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, &quot;Howl&quot;, his
            most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start. </p>
