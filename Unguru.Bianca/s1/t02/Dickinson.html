            Emily Dickinson
        </h1>


        <p> December 10, 1830 &hyphen; May 15, 1886 </p>
        <p> Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts into a prominent family with strong ties to its community.
            After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount
            Holyoke
            Female Seminary before returning to her family's house in Amherst </p>
        <p>Some argue that Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation. Considered an eccentric by
            locals,
            she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests
            or,
            later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and
            others depended entirely upon correspondence. </p>
        <p>While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were published
            during her lifetime. The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly
            by
            the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Her poems are unique for the era in
            which
            she wrote&semi; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as
            unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and
            immortality,
            two recurring topics in letters to her friends.</p>
        <p>Times article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name &quot;Susan&quot; was
            often
            deliberately removed. At least 11 of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to sister&hyphen;in&hyphen;law
            Susan
            Huntington Gilbert Dickinson, though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd. A
            complete,
            and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas
            H.
            Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955. </p>
