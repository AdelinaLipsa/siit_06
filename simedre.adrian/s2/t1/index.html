                <h1>History of the Ford Escape</h1>
                <p>Customers are flocking to small crossover SUVs in droves for their combination of all-weather performance and family function with improved cargo carrying capabilities compared to traditional sedans. Case in point, the Escape is now Ford's best-selling nameplate outside of its F-Series pickup trucks. Last year, 272,228 Escapes found new homes to better both the Focus (113,345) and Fusion (173,600). And throughout its lifetime, more than 4 million have been sold in the US.</p>
                <p>It's a similar story at other automakers with Escape competitors such as the Honda CR-V, Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV4 all sitting at the top of each respective company's sales charts. Where today's Escape struggles against its Japanese rivals is that it's simply old in comparison having originally launched way back in 2013. The Nissan isn't much newer landing in 2014, but the Honda and Toyota were both completely redone over the past couple of years.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, there's an all-new 2020 Ford Escape on the horizon packing a fresh design, powertrains and technology. But before the fourth-generation model lands in showrooms this fall, let's take a quick look back at the history of the Blue Oval's compact SUV.</p>
