            <h1 class="box a" data-aos="fade-up">Arcul de Triumf</h1>
            <p class="box a" data-aos="animation_name">Arcul de Triumf is a triumphal arch located in the northern part of Bucharest, on the Kiseleff Road.</p>
            <p class="box a" data-aos="fade-up">The first, wooden, triumphal arch was built hurriedly, after Romania gained its independence (1878), so that the victorious troops could march under it. Another arch with concrete skeleton and plaster exterior of elaborate sculptures and decoration designed by Petre Antonescu was built on the same site after World War I in 1922. The arch exterior, which had seriously decayed, was replaced in 1935 by the current much more sober Neoclassical design, more closely modelled in the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The new arch, also designed by Petre Antonescu and executed in stone, was inaugurated on 1 December 1936.</p>
            <p class="box b" data-aos="animation_name">The arch has a height of 27 metres. It has as its foundation a 25 x 11.50 metres rectangle. The sculptures with which the facades are decorated were created by famous Romanian sculptors such as Ion Jalea and Dimitrie Paciurea.</p>
            <p class="box a" data-aos="fade-up">Presently, military parades are held beneath the arch each December 1, with the occasion of Romania's national holiday.</p>
            <p class="box b" data-aos="animation_name">Elisabeta Palace, the current residence of the Romanian Royal Family, is located near the Arch of Triumph, in Herăstrău Park.</p>
            <p class="box a" data-aos="fade-up">The Triumphal Arch (Arcul de Triumf) of Bucharest, which is located on the Kiseleff Street, was declared a historical monument in 2004. It is one of the most notable landmarks of the capital and, next to the Parliament Palace, it can be deemed a symbol of Bucharest. The structure of the current Triumphal Arch dates back to 1922, whereas the present decorative elements were added only 16 years later, in 1938, the year when the monument, in its final form, was inaugurated.</p>
            <p class="box b" data-aos="animation_name">However, the history of the monument dates back to the mid 19th century. Until 1922, previous versions of the arch were hastily and repeatedly built in 1848, 1859, 1878, 1906 and 1918, in order to mark certain military and political achievements of Romania. Yet, given the perishable nature of the construction material (chiefly wood), these versions did not survive.</p>
            <p class="box a" data-aos="fade-up">The reinforced concrete structure was inaugurated in 1922, in order to celebrate the victory of Romania in World War One, and the event was attended by the most important political figures of the time, including foreign politicians from Europe, Japan and the USA. The bearing structure of the edifice survived in time, but the decorative elements (bas-reliefs chiefly) were made of plaster, and they decayed rapidly. This is why they were replaced with marble and stone elements, mainly allegorical sculptures realized by sundry artists of the time, under the supervision of Petre Antonescu, the same architect who designed the bearing structure of the 1922 arch.</p>
            <p class="box b" data-aos="animation_name">At present, the Triumphal Arch dominates the surroundings of the Kiseleff Street, marking the intersection of this thoroughfare with the Constantin Brezan Boulevard, the Alexandru Averescu Boulevard and with the Alexandru Constantinescu Boulevard. It is one of the emblematic monuments of the capital and a tourist sight just as important as the C.E.C. Palace, the Parliament Palace or the Romanian Athenaeum.</p>

            <p class="box b" data-aos="animation_name">Bucharest is deceptively big, a great way to see the city and hear about the history that surrounds the likes of Arcul de Triumf is to take a bike tour. The arch is located near the King Michael I Park (formerly known as Herăstrău Park), at the intersection of Kiseleff Road and Mareșal Alexandru Averescu Blvd., bus station "Arcul de Triumf".</p>
