            <h1> Nichita Stanescu</h1>
            <p>31 March 1933– 13 December 1983</p>
            <p>Stănescu's father was Nicolae Hristea Stănescu (1908–1982). His mother, Tatiana Cereaciuchin, was Russian
                (originally from Voronezh, she had fled Russia and married in 1931). Nichita Stănescu finished high
                school in Ploieşti, then went on to study Romanian language and literature in Bucharest, graduating in
                1957. He made his literary debut in the Tribuna literary magazine.</p>
            <p>Stănescu married Magdalena Petrescu in 1952, but the couple separated a year later. In 1962 he married
                Doina Ciurea. In 1982 he married Todoriţa "Dora" Tărâță.

                For much of his career, Stănescu was a contributor to and editor of Gazeta Literară, România Literară
                and Luceafărul.

                His editorial debut was the poetry book Sensul iubirii ("The Aim of Love"), which appeared under the
                Luceafărul selection, in 1960. He also was the recipient of numerous awards for his verse, the most
                important being the Herder Prize in 1975 and a nomination for the Nobel Prize in 1980.[1] The last
                volume of poetry published in his lifetime was Noduri şi semne ("Knots and Signs"), published in 1982. A
                heavy drinker, he died of cardiopulmonary arrest.</p>
